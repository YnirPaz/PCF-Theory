    "It was long known that $\\text{ZFC}$ decides almost nothing about the\n",
    "power operation on cardinals, $\\kappa \\mapsto 2 ^ \\kappa$, for regular\n",
    "cardinals $\\kappa$. For example even assuming\n",
    "$2 ^ {\\aleph_4} = \\aleph_5$, so the power function is as small as it can\n",
    "be below $\\aleph_5$, we still have that $2 ^ {\\aleph_5}$ can be\n",
    "arbitrarily large. This idea is formalized with Easton’s theorem, which\n",
    "proves the only constraints of the power operation on regular cardinals\n",
    "are a few “obvious” ones, such as monotonicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was thought the situation was similar for singular cardinals, until\n",
    "in 1974 Silver showed that if $2 ^ \\kappa = \\kappa^+$ for every\n",
    "$\\kappa < \\aleph_ {\\omega_1}$, then\n",
    "$2 ^ {\\aleph_ {\\omega_1}} = \\aleph_ {\\omega_1 + 1}$. That is, the\n",
    "generalized continuum hypothesis can’t fail for the first time at\n",
    "$\\aleph_ {\\omega_1}$ (or more generally at any singular cardinal with\n",
    "uncountable cofinality). This was the first indication that a unifying,\n",
    "Easton-like theorem may not exist for singular cardinals, and soon many\n",
    "set-theorists took inspiration and started working on the problem of\n",
    "understanding powers of singular cardinals.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the natural ways for the power function to be small below a\n",
    "cardinal $\\kappa$ is for powers of cardinals below it to stay below it.\n",
    "That is, for every $\\lambda < \\kappa$, we also have\n",
    "$2 ^ \\lambda < \\kappa$. Such a $\\kappa$ is called a strong limit\n",
    "cardinal. In 1975 Glavin and Hajnal bounded the value of\n",
    "$2 ^ {\\aleph_{\\omega_1}}$, assuming $\\aleph_{\\omega_1}$ is a strong\n",
    "limit cardinal. Much like Silver’s theorem this result was the first of\n",

    "open problem at the time. PCF theory has since found applications in\n",
    "many areas around set theory, including model theory, infinitary logic\n",
    "and general topology, but in particular it has hugely improved our\n",

    "The long-term goal of the project is to formalize enough PCF theory to\n",

    "$$\n",
    "  \\text{If } \\aleph_\\omega \\text{ is a strong limit cardinal, then } 2 ^ {\\aleph_ \\omega} < \\aleph_ {\\omega_4}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The current short-term goal is prove the representation theorem for\n",
    "successors of singular cardinals (theorem 2.23), and use it to construct\n",
    "a Jónsson algebra on $\\aleph_ {\\omega + 1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "As the project is just starting and the basic notions of PCF theory are\n",
    "not defined, there aren’t many disjoint tasks to work on yet. Once the\n",
    "foundations of the project solidify there will hopefully be many\n",
    "independent TODOs and isolated sorrys.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Prove the countable case of\n",
    "    `exists_isClubGuessing_of_cof_uncountable`. This is exercise 2.18.2\n",
    "    in the Handbook and there is a hint that describes the variation on\n",
    "    the uncountable case construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background/** contains files with theorems not specific to PCF theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ClubGuessing.lean** proves the basic club guessing principles needed\n",
    "for PCF theory. These are theorem 2.17 and the following exercise in the\n",
    "Handbook."
